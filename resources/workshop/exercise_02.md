## Exercise 2: Connect to your Stitch Application

In this exercise, you will connect to your Stitch App using the Stitch JavaScript Browser SDK and implement authentication.

### Initialize the Stitch App Client

Normally, you would have to install the [Stitch JavaScript Browser SDK](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch-sdks/js/4/index.html) using npm in a terminal like the following:

```
> npm install mongodb-stitch-browser-sdk
```

but we have done that for you.

First, we'll grab the Stitch App ID

- Go back to the Stitch Admin Console and copy your App ID from the left hand side menu. It should look something like `picstream-asdfg`.
- In the constructor of [`App.js`][1], paste your App ID. It should look like the following

```
this.appId = 'picstream-asdfg'
```

Next, we'll use that to initialize a Stitch App Client and save it as an instance variable. We do this in the `componentDidMount()` life cycle function of the App component. Add the following to the top of this function:

```javascript
this.client = Stitch.initializeAppClient(this.appId)
```

### Implement Authentication

Now that we have an App Client, we can take care of authentication. We need to handle logging in and out, and check to see if an auth session already exists. All this can be done using `this.client.auth`.

Let's start with login, find the `login()` function in the [`App`][1] component. To log in using Email and Password, add the following to the the function:

```javascript
const credential = new UserPasswordCredential(email, password)
const user = await this.client.auth.loginWithCredential(credential)
```

To log out, find the `logout()` function and add the following line to the top:

```javascript
this.client.auth.logout()
```

Now we need to check when the component mounts whether or not the client is logged in. In the `componentDidMount()` life cycle function of the [`App`][1] component, change the value of `isAuthed` to the result of `this.client.auth.isLoggedIn`. It should look like the following:

```javascript
const isAuthed = this.client.auth.isLoggedIn
```

## Next Exercise

You should now be able to log in with any of the 3 users you created in the previous exercise. Give it a try. See what happens when you use an incorrect login. In the [next exercise](./exercise_03.md), we'll connect AWS to your Stitch application so you can store uploaded images in S3.
